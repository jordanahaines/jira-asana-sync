# Jira Asana Sync
This is a python script that creates Asana tasks for Jira issues. More specifically, this script will retrieve Jira tasks assigned to a specific user in a specific sprint, and will create an Asana task in a specified project for each Jira issue. When Asana tasks are completed, their corresponding Jira task will be completed. Asana tasks in the project that do not have a corresponding incomplete Jira task will be deleted.
